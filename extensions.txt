I added sound effects whenever the ball hits the brick or the paddle. I also kept score.
The score increased differently for different points of the game. The increment
depends on how much speed of the ball, which increased everytime the ball hit the
paddle, and which brick was hit. (The brick in the back were worth more
points) I also added levels. As the level went up, the ball was faster.
